# Parakeet Real-time Audio Transcriber

A professional real-time audio transcription system using NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT 0.6B V2 model with advanced voice activity detection and intelligent sentence grouping.

## Features

### Smart Audio Processing
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Only processes audio when speech is detected
- **Intelligent Segmentation**: Waits for natural pauses to capture complete thoughts
- **Sentence Grouping**: Combines fragments into complete, coherent sentences
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Eliminates repetitive and overlapping transcriptions
- **Rolling Buffer**: 3-second overlap prevents information loss between segments

### Audio Capture
- **System Audio**: Capture any audio playing on your computer
- **Microphone Input**: Direct voice transcription
- **Background Music Support**: Transcribe audio from streaming services, videos, meetings

### Database Storage
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database for scalable storage
- **Timestamped Segments**: Each sentence stored with precise timing
- **Recording Sessions**: Group transcriptions by recording name/session
- **Query & Retrieval**: Full history of all transcriptions with search capabilities
- **Automatic Schema Setup**: Database schema applied automatically during setup

### Advanced AI
- **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B V2**: State-of-the-art ASR model optimized for English
- **600M Parameters**: High-quality transcription with proper punctuation
- **Parakeet Best Practices**: 5-20 second segments for optimal accuracy
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains context across audio boundaries

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

#### Install Background Music (for system audio capture)
```bash
# Install Background Music for system audio capture
brew install background-music

# Start Background Music
open /Applications/Background\ Music.app
```

#### Fix Audio Echoing Issues (if needed)
If you experience audio echoing or distortion:
```bash
# Kill and restart Core Audio daemon
sudo killall coreaudiod

# Restart Background Music
open /Applications/Background\ Music.app
```

### 2. Setup Project
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd python-audio

# Run setup script (installs uv and dependencies)
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 3. Database Setup

The project uses Neon PostgreSQL for cloud database storage. Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct Neon connection string:

```bash
# Example .env configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database_name?sslmode=require
```

Test your database connection:
```bash
python test_neon_connection.py
```

### 4. Activate Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Run Transcriber
```bash
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **macOS/Linux** (Windows support planned)
- **2GB+ RAM** for model loading
- **Background Music** (for system audio capture)
- **Audio input device** (microphone or system audio)

## Configuration Options

### VAD Sensitivity
Adjust the Voice Activity Detection sensitivity (0-3):
```python
transcriber = AudioTranscriber(vad_aggressiveness=2)  # Default: 2
```

- `0`: Least aggressive (detects more background noise as speech)
- `1`: Low aggressiveness 
- `2`: **Default** - Good balance
- `3`: Most aggressive (only clear speech detected)

### Segment Duration
Adjust audio segment length for processing:
```python
transcriber = AudioTranscriber(
    max_segment_duration=20,  # Max seconds per segment
    min_segment_duration=5    # Min seconds per segment
)
```

### Pause Detection
Adjust pause detection timing:
```python
transcriber = AudioTranscriber(
    pause_threshold=0.8,      # Seconds to trigger processing
    silence_threshold=1.5     # Seconds for full reset
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Transcribe System Audio
Perfect for:
- YouTube videos and tutorials
- Zoom/Teams meetings
- Streaming content and podcasts
- Live presentations

```bash
# Select "Background Music" device when prompted
python main.py
> Enter device ID: 1  # Background Music
```

### Transcribe Microphone
Perfect for:
- Voice notes and dictation
- Meeting notes
- Live conversations
- Interview transcription

```bash
# Select microphone device when prompted
python main.py
> Enter device ID: 3  # MacBook Pro Microphone
```

## How It Works

### 1. Voice Activity Detection
```
Audio Input → VAD Analysis → Speech/Silence Classification
```

### 2. Intelligent Buffering
```
Speech Detected → Rolling Buffer (3s overlap) → Pause Detection → Process Segment
```

### 3. Parakeet Processing
```
Audio Segment (5-20s) → Parakeet Model → Raw Transcription → Post-processing
```

### 4. Sentence Intelligence
```
Raw Text → Sentence Grouping → Duplicate Filtering → Clean Output
```

[21:35:54] An enormous 192 gigabytes of unified memory, which is 50% more than M1 Ultra, enabling it to do things other chips just can't do.
[21:35:54] For example, in a single system, it can train massive ML workloads like large transformer models that the most powerful discrete GPU.
[21:36:14] Can't even process because it runs out of memory.
[21:36:14] So that's M2 Ultra, our largest and most capable chip ever.
[21:36:34] And today, we're bringing M2 Ultra to Mac Studio, taking performance even further.
