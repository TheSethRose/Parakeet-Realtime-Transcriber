# Parakeet Real-time Audio Transcriber

A professional real-time audio transcription system using NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT 0.6B V2 model with advanced voice activity detection and intelligent sentence grouping.

## Features

### Smart Audio Processing
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Only processes audio when speech is detected
- **Intelligent Segmentation**: Waits for natural pauses to capture complete thoughts
- **Sentence Grouping**: Combines fragments into complete, coherent sentences
- **Duplicate Filtering**: Eliminates repetitive and overlapping transcriptions
- **Rolling Buffer**: 3-second overlap prevents information loss between segments

### Audio Capture
- **System Audio**: Capture any audio playing on your computer
- **Microphone Input**: Direct voice transcription
- **Background Music Support**: Transcribe audio from streaming services, videos, meetings

### Database Storage
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database for scalable storage
- **Timestamped Segments**: Each sentence stored with precise timing
- **Recording Sessions**: Group transcriptions by recording name/session
- **Query & Retrieval**: Full history of all transcriptions with search capabilities
- **Automatic Schema Setup**: Database schema applied automatically during setup

### Advanced AI
- **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B V2**: State-of-the-art ASR model optimized for English
- **600M Parameters**: High-quality transcription with proper punctuation
- **Parakeet Best Practices**: 5-20 second segments for optimal accuracy
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains context across audio boundaries

## Quick Start

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).

### Basic Setup
1. **Install Prerequisites** - Background Music app for system audio capture
2. **Clone Project** - Download and navigate to the project directory
3. **Run Setup** - `./setup.sh` to install dependencies
4. **Configure Database** - Set up your Neon PostgreSQL connection
5. **Run Transcriber** - `python main.py`

## Documentation

All documentation is available in the `/docs` folder:

- **[Setup Guide](docs/setup.md)** - Complete installation and configuration instructions
- **[Usage Guide](docs/usage.md)** - How to use the transcriber for different scenarios
- **[API Documentation](docs/api.md)** - Integration and programmatic usage
- **[Database Setup](docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md)** - Database configuration and schema details
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **macOS/Linux** (Windows support planned)
- **2GB+ RAM** for model loading
- **Background Music** (for system audio capture)
- **Audio input device** (microphone or system audio)

For detailed requirements and installation instructions, see the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).

## How It Works

### 1. Voice Activity Detection
```
Audio Input → VAD Analysis → Speech/Silence Classification
```

### 2. Intelligent Buffering
```
Speech Detected → Rolling Buffer (3s overlap) → Pause Detection → Process Segment
```

### 3. Parakeet Processing
```
Audio Segment (5-20s) → Parakeet Model → Raw Transcription → Post-processing
```

### 4. Sentence Intelligence
```
Raw Text → Sentence Grouping → Duplicate Filtering → Clean Output
```

[21:35:54] An enormous 192 gigabytes of unified memory, which is 50% more than M1 Ultra, enabling it to do things other chips just can't do.
[21:35:54] For example, in a single system, it can train massive ML workloads like large transformer models that the most powerful discrete GPU.
[21:36:14] Can't even process because it runs out of memory.
[21:36:14] So that's M2 Ultra, our largest and most capable chip ever.
[21:36:34] And today, we're bringing M2 Ultra to Mac Studio, taking performance even further.
